    Yeah....She loves him. <strong>(She made this photo)</strong><br>Now there is a little history with these cats that I would like to share with you! First you might be wondering why we called one of our cats Stormageddon Meatball.<br>Well we didn't adopt him from the animal shelter he was a stray cat.<br> It all happened when we were eating meatballs for dinner and we heard this cat meowing outside during a storm so we let it inside<br> and we didn't have a cat so we had no cat food but we did have...<br> <strong>Meatballs!</strong>So we gave him the meatballs and he love them. The thing was was that he was really skinny<br> so he was desperate for food, shelter, and water. He loved snuggling so my brother and I of course asked to keep him and my mom's resonse was not yes or no it was "Maybe" <br>but my brother and I loved cats so we took that as a yes. And we took him the vet the next day in a little cat carrier problem was was that he was gonna get bigger he was so skinny that he could fit in a carrier half his size. So when we decided to keep him the vet gave us a new carrier. And we had to think of a name so we thoght Stormy because it was a stormy night and the we thought Doctor Who so Stormageddon and he ate meatballs so Stormageddon Meatball it is!<br>The End
  </p>

<h2>My trip to the OBX</h2>
<p>
  I like to go to a nunber of different places but here is a trip that I loved so much and I will share it with you!<br>I really liked going on a vacation to the OBX North Carolina (Outer Banks) we rented a trailer and a really nice van to take us there.<br>The van we rented was so cool it had doors that you just pull on the handle and it opend automaticaly and it has a DVD player so we could watch a movie in the car while we went to bed because it took 1 day and 1 night to get there.<br>The trailer we rented had a bedroom for the kids and one for the adults. And we had a bathroom right next to our bedroom but the bad thing was was that it had no door between the bedroom and the bathroom and it was kinda small.<br> And I kinda noticed that the adults were not using the bathroom and the adult didn't let us in their room at all but it wasn't really suspicous because they didn't want kids in their room.<br>But my brother walked into the adults room and there were these doors that looked like a closet but it was huge so he opened them and there was htis huge bathroom in their room.<br>It had 2 sinks in there and a huge mirror and room to put their stuff. I was so mad that I had to deal with using the bathroom that had no door between them. (but it was also kinda funny) <br> The End
</p>

<p>
  But that was definatly not the only thing that happened keep reading!<br>We did a lot of fun activities there like catching crabs, going to a number of beaches, and climbing the Hatteras Light house.
