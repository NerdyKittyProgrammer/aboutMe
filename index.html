    Now there is a little history with these cats that I would like to share with you! First<br /> you might be wondering why we called one of our cats Stormageddon Meatball.<br>Well we didn't adopt him from the animal shelter he was a stray cat.<br> It all happened when we were eating meatballs for dinner and we heard a cat<br /> meowing outside during a storm so we let it inside<br> and we didn't have a cat so we had no cat food but we did have...<br> <strong>Meatballs!</strong>So we gave him the meatballs and he loved them. But he was<br /> was really skinny so he was desperate for food. He loved snuggling so<br /> my brother and I of course asked to keep him and my mom's resonse was not yes or no it was "Maybe" <br>but my brother and I loved cats so we took that as a yes. And we took him the vet the next day in a little<br /> cat carrier problem was was that he was gonna get bigger he was so skinny that he could fit in a carrier<br /> half his size. So when we decided to keep him the vet gave us a new carrier. And we had to think of a name<br /> so we thoght Stormy because it was a stormy night and the we thought Doctor Who so Stormageddon and he<br /> ate meatballs so Stormageddon Meatball it is!<br>The End

  <h3>My trip to the OBX</h3>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
      I like to go to a nunber of different places but here is a trip that I loved so much and I will share it with you!<br>I really liked going on a vacation to the OBX North Carolina (Outer Banks) we rented a trailer and a really<br /> nice van to take
      us there. The van we rented was so cool it had doors that you just pull on the handle and it<br /> opened automaticaly and it has a DVD player so we could watch a movie in the car while we went to bed<br /> because it took 1 day and 1 night to get
      there. In our trailer we had a kids room and an adult room and in the<br /> adult room the adults were keeping a secret about how they had a secret bathroom in their room that we didn't<br /> find out about until the last day. We did a lot of fun
      activities when we were there. One of the days we caught<br /> fresh crab and made Mac & Cheese. We even took a Ferry to get to Roanoke island and made a camp fire and<br /> saw a bunch of ghost crabs that only come out at night. And we climbed
      the Hatteras lighthouse here's a picture.

  <h3>My trip to Kentucky Down Under Adventure Zoo</h3>
  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
      We went to a zoo in kentuckey and it was the best zoo I have ever been to! <a href="http://www.kentuckydownunder.com/adventure_zoo_info/adventure_zoo.html">http://www.kentuckydownunder.com</a><br>There were multiple types of birds, snakes and even
      Kangaroo's and Emu's. We got to feed the kangaroo's strips of<br /> carrots with our mouths! All you would have to do was put the piece of carrot in your mouth and get down close to them<br /> and they would eat it. And the Emu's were huge! It was
      like a dinosaur! There was a section of the zoo that had nothing but birds<br /> and my aunt came along to but she's afraid of birds. But she came in handy because she was the only one who could roll her R's.<br /> We needed that for the Laughing
      kookaburra if you rolled your R's it would make a noise that would sound like it's laughing.<br /> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laughing_kookaburra">Read more about the Laughing kookaburra </a>

  <h2 id="howIlearned">How I learned/what I know</h2>
  <p class="paragraph">
    It was actually pretty recently that I learned html/css and I learned it on a website called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>.<br /> It's a website where you can take different free courses onine and learn all
    sorts of things<br />such as Math, Science, Language Arts, Social Studies, Computer coding, Computer animation, engineering,<br /> and much more. I took the Intro to HTML/CSS Course. And i'm really glad I did I learned a lot of tags.<br /> Like headings,
    paragraphs, unordered lists, ordered lists, how to use classes and id's, how to use links, how to<br /> make a table, How to insert images, how to set background colors, and more! And I have learned some things outside<br /> of Khan Academy like as
    you probobly have noticed the spining cats well that's a css rule that a friend gave to me to use<br /> and I watched a YouTube video on how to make drop down menus.
  </p>

  <p>
    But that's not the only way I learned it's where I have most of my knowlege from but before that I used a website called <a target="_blank" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a><br /> and if you know what that is it's basicaly a programming
    website for kids where instead of writing code you conect blocks and it's really fun and I recomend<br /> it for kids because it's so easy and you can make a lot of stuff on there so go check it out.
