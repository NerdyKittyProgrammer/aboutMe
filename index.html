    Yeah....She loves him. <strong>(She made this photo)</strong>But she loves me and my brother too!<br>Now there is a little history with these cats that I would like to share with you! First you might be wondering why we called one of our cats Stormageddon Meatball.<br>Well we didn't adopt him from the animal shelter he was a stray cat.<br> It all happened when we were eating meatballs for dinner and we heard this cat meowing outside during a storm so we let it inside<br> and we didn't have a cat so we had no cat food but we did have...<br> <strong>Meatballs!</strong>So we gave him the meatballs and he love them. The thing was was that he was really skinny<br> so he was desperate for food, shelter, and water. He loved snuggling so my brother and I of course asked to keep him and my mom's resonse was not yes or no it was "Maybe" <br>but my brother and I loved cats so we took that as a yes. And we took him the vet the next day in a little cat carrier problem was was that he was gonna get bigger he was so skinny that he could fit in a carrier half his size. So when we decided to keep him the vet gave us a new carrier. And we had to think of a name so we thoght Stormy because it was a stormy night and the we thought Doctor Who so Stormageddon and he ate meatballs so Stormageddon Meatball it is!<br>The End

  <h3>My trip to the OBX</h3>
  <p>
    I like to go to a nunber of different places but here is a trip that I loved so much and I will share it with you!<br>I really liked going on a vacation to the OBX North Carolina (Outer Banks) we rented a trailer and a really nice van to take us there.<br>The
    van we rented was so cool it had doors that you just pull on the handle and it opend automaticaly and it has a DVD player so we could watch a movie in the car while we went to bed because it took 1 day and 1 night to get there.<br>In our trailer we
    had a kids room and an adult room and in the adult room the adults were keeping a secret about how they had a secret bathroom in their room that we didn't find out about until the last day.<br>We did a lot of fun activities when we were there. One
    of the days we caught fresh crab and made Mac & Cheese. We even took a Ferry to get to Roanoke island and made a camp fire and saw a bunch of ghost crabs that only come out at night. And we climbed the Hatteras lighthouse here's a picture.

    The Hatteras lighthouse is 193 feet tall the tallest out of all the light houses in the OBX. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.outerbanks.com/lighthouses.html">Read more about OBX here</a>

  <h3>My trip to Kentucky Down Under Adventure Zoo</h3>

  <p>
    We went to a zoo in kentuckey and it was the best zoo I have ever been to! <a href="http://www.kentuckydownunder.com/adventure_zoo_info/adventure_zoo.html">http://www.kentuckydownunder.com</a><br>There were multiple types of birds, snakes and even
    Kangaroo's and Emu's. We got to feed the kangaroo's strips of carrots with our mouths!<br />All you would have to do was put the piece of carrot in your mouth and get down close to them and they would eat it.<br />And the Emu's were huge! It was like
    a dinosaur. There was a section of the zoo that had nothing but birds and my aunt came along to but she's afraid of birds.<br />But she came in hand because she was the only one who could roll her R's. We needed that for the Laughing kookaburra if
    you rolled your R's it would make a noise that would sound like it's laughing.<br /> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laughing_kookaburra">Read more about the Laughing kookaburra </a>
