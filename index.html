      <strong>Hi my name is Lyela, here is a little into to me! Hope you enjoy!</strong><br>I am a 12 year old girl who has many hobbies and loves to code. I made a github account bacause I loved coding so much and I wanted to get more into it! But I had to figure out a username that was not already taken by someone else. At first it was NerdyProgrammer but that was taken so I added kitty because I love cats! So NerdyKittyProgrammer or NKP for short. My experience with programming is not professional but not completely new to programming so in the middle. So far I only know html/css. In
      fact this webpage your reading right now is written in you guessed it html and css. The things I do most often (for fun) is Programming and Drawing. But I also like video games like Minecraft, Animal Jam, Mario Games, etc. My
      favorite subject in school is Math but here is a list from my favorite to my least favorite!<br> 1.Math
      <br> 2.Social Studies<br> 3.STEM Foundations <br> 4.Language Arts<br />5.Science

</p>

<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    Now there is a little history with these cats that I would like to share with you!</p>

<h3>The History of Stormageddon Meatball</h3>

    <p>First, you might be wondering why we called one of our cats Stormageddon Meatball it's kind of a strange name.<br>Well we didn't adopt him from the animal shelter. He was a stray cat. It all happened when we were eating meatballs for dinner and we heard a cat meowing outside during a storm. We let it inside. Because we didn't have a cat so we had no cat food but we did have... <strong>Meatballs!</strong> So we gave him the meatballs and he loved them. But he was was really skinny so he was desperate for food. He loved snuggling, so my brother and I of course asked to keep him. My mom's response was not yes or no; it was, "Maybe". But my brother and I loved cats so we took that as a yes. And we took him the to vet the next day in a cat carrier that was half his size. He was so skinny that he could fit into it just by crouching. We decided to keep him, and the vet gave us a new carrier. Now we had to think of a name for him. So we thought of Stormy, because it was a stormy night when he showed up. Then we thought of Doctor Who and named him Stormageddon. And he ate meatballs, so Stormageddon Meatball it was! And it still is.<br>The End
  </p>

<h3>The History of Myrna Pepperoni</h3>
<p>
It all begins with a facebook post, where an adorable grey kitten was looking for a home. My dad really wanted to bring this kitten home. But he was not the only one who felt that way, and someone else got the kitten before him. But the woman who was trying to find it a home kept an eye out for a different cat for him. A few weeks later, she came back and told him about another kitty. She described the cat as, "black, very loving, calm, and petite". He was interested. The next day, there came a cuddley picture and a video. About five days later, he went to an animal clinic in Dayton to pick her up and bring her home for the night. Myrna spent about 2 hours exploring his apartment, after which she got up onto the couch with him, leaned against his hip and fell asleep. The next day he decided to keep her.

  <h3>My trip to the OBX</h3>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
      I like to go to a number of different places but here is a trip that I loved so much and I will share with you! I really liked going on a vacation to the OBX North Carolina (Outer Banks) we rented a trailer and a really nice van to take
      us there. The van we rented was so cool it had doors that you just pull on the handle and it opened automaticaly and it has a DVD player so we could watch a movie in the car while we went to bed because it took 1 day and 1 night to get
      there. In our trailer we had a kids room and an adult room and in the adult room the adults were keeping a secret about how they had a secret bathroom in their room that we didn't find out about until the last day. We did a lot of fun
      activities when we were there. One of the days we caught fresh crab and made Mac & Cheese. We even took a Ferry to get to Roanoke island and made a camp fire and saw a bunch of ghost crabs that only come out at night. And we climbed
      the Hatteras lighthouse here's a picture.

    The Hatteras lighthouse is 193 feet tall the tallest out of all the light houses in the OBX. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.outerbanks.com/lighthouses.html">Read more about OBX here</a>

  <h3>My trip to Kentucky Down Under Adventure Zoo</h3>
  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
      We went to a zoo in kentuckey and it was the best zoo I have ever been to! <a href="http://www.kentuckydownunder.com/adventure_zoo_info/adventure_zoo.html">http://www.kentuckydownunder.com</a><br>There were multiple types of birds, snakes and even
      Kangaroo's and Emu's. We got to feed the kangaroo's strips of carrots with our mouths! All you would have to do was put the piece of carrot in your mouth and get down close to them<br /> and they would eat it. The Emu's were huge! It was
      like a dinosaur! There was a section of the zoo that had nothing but birds and my aunt came along to but she's afraid of birds. But she came in handy because she was the only one who could roll her R's. We needed that for the Laughing
      kookaburra if you rolled your R's it would make a noise that would sound like it's laughing.<br /> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laughing_kookaburra">Read more about the Laughing kookaburra </a>

  <h3>My favorite activities!</h3>
  <p class="paragraph">
    One of my most favorite things to do is do stuff out doors and I love camping even though you get really gross afterwards. You just take a shower and it's all worth it. I love camping because you can sleep outside and hear the crickets and enjoy nature
    and you can make smores and cook over the fire and do a lot of fun activities.Another thing I like to do is go fishing and I admit i'm not good a fishing but it's fun! I like to go swimming, Canoeing/kyaking, baking, processing quail (I
    really did take a quail processing class), hiking, cooking, and more.</p>

    I like a lot of TV shows and movies but I have picked a few that I personally like. (not in order)<br /><strong>TV Shows</strong><br /> Doctor Who<br />Stranger Things<br />Mystery Science Theater 3000<br />A Series of Unfortunate Events<br />

  <p>
    <strong>Movies</strong><br />Back to the Future<br />Moana<br>Song of the sea<br />Thor: Ragnarok

  <h2 id="howIlearned">How I learned/what I know</h2>
  <p class="paragraph">
    It was actually pretty recently that I learned html/css and I learned it on a website called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>.<br /> It's a website where you can take different free courses onine and learn all
    sorts of things like Math, Science, Language Arts, Social Studies, Computer coding, Computer animation, engineering, and much more. I took the Intro to HTML/CSS Course. And i'm really glad I did I learned a lot of tags. Like headings,
    paragraphs, unordered lists, ordered lists, how to use classes and id's, how to use links, how to make a table, How to insert images, how to set background colors, and more! And I have learned some things outside of Khan Academy like as
    you probobly have noticed the spining cats well that's a css rule that a friend gave to me to use and I watched a YouTube video on how to make drop down menus.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    But that's not the only way I learned it's where I have most of my knowlege from but before that I used a website called <a target="_blank" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a><br /> and if you know what that is it's basicaly a programming
    website for kids where instead of writing code you conect blocks and it's really fun and I recomend<br /> it for kids because it's so easy and you can make a lot of stuff on there so go check it out.
